Status

    Draft

Version

    3 - April 29, 2015

Number

    TBD

Extension Type

    Display extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_KHR_stream
    Requires EGL_NV_stream_attrib
    Requires EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display

    This extension is written against the wording of the EGL 1.5
    specification, but may be used with older versions that support
    EGLAttribKHR.

Overview

    This extension provides means for a Wayland compositor to create
    the consumer endpoint of an EGLStream from a wl_resource. The EGL
    implementation must provide one or more interfaces in the Wayland
    protocol to allow Wayland clients to create wl_resource objects
    that represent an EGLStream.

IP Status

    No known IP issues.

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted in the <attrib_list> parameter of eglCreateStreamAttribNV:

        EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL                0x334B

Add to the EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display extension specification after
the section describing how to create EGLImage objects from a wl_buffer:

    A wl_resource can be bound to an EGLStream in the compositor. A
    pointer to wl_resource must be passed as EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL
    attribute in <attrib_list> of eglCreateStreamAttribNV. In case of
    success, eglCreateStreamAttribNV will return an EGLStream handle
    associated to the given wl_resource, which can be used by the
    compositor to attach a consumer and start acquiring frames from the
    wayland client (producer). Otherwise, EGL_NO_STREAM_KHR will be
    returned and an EGL error will be generated.

Add a new entry to table "Table 3.10.4.4 EGLStream Attributes" of the
EGL_KHR_stream extension specification:

        Attribute                   Read/Write   Type          Section
        --------------------------  ----------   ------        --------
        EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL        wo       *wl_resource  3.10.4.x

Add a new subsection 3.10.4.x at the end of section "3.10.4 EGLStream
Attributes" of the EGL_KHR_stream extension specification:

    3.10.4.x EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL Attribute

    This attribute is only accepted by eglCreateStreamAttribNV. It
    allows a wayland compositor to create a consumer endpoint EGLStream
    instance from a given wl_resource. The valid value for this
    attribute is a pointer to a wl_resource.

Add to the list of failures of eglCreateStreamAttribNV in the
EGL_NV_stream_attrib extension specification:

    - EGL_BAD_MATCH is generated if <attrib_list> contains multiple
      EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL attributes.

    - EGL_BAD_ACCESS is generated if <attrib_list> contains an
      EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL attribute and the corresponding
      wl_resource pointer is NULL or does not represent a valid
      EGLStream.

    - EGL_BAD_ACCESS is generated if <attrib_list> contains an
      EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL attribute and one or more producer-side
      specific attributes.

    - EGL_BAD_STREAM_KHR is generated if <attrib_list> contains an
      EGL_WAYLAND_EGLSTREAM_WL attribute and the corresponding
      wl_resource pointer represents a previously created EGLStream.
