    Draft

Version

    Version 5 - January 27, 2017

Number

    TBD

Extension Type

    EGL display extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_output_drm
    Requires EGL_NV_stream_attrib
    Requires EGL_EXT_stream_acquire_mode
    Interacts with drmModePageFlip() method from libdrm

Overview

    With the EGLDevice and EGLOutput family of extensions, EGL and its
    client APIs can be used in place of "native" rendering APIs to
    implement the basic graphics functionality of native windowing
    systems.

    Presentation of new frames is handled internally in EGL, and its
    clients may require notification when such action is complete.

    In the case where display state changes are performed using
    DRM-KMS operations, this extension provides means to clients to
    share information with EGL so they can get notified when a page
    flip is complete.

    Currently, KMS CRTC EGLOutput stream consumers are the only defined
    mechanism allowing page flip notification.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute in the <attrib_list> parameter of
    eglStreamConsumerAcquireAttribNV.

    EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV                  0x333E

Add new entry to table "Table 3.10.2.a EGLStream Consumer Acquire
Attributes" in EGL_NV_stream_attrib:

    Attribute                   Type        Section
    --------------------------  ----------  -------
    EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV  pointer     3.10.5.1.1

Add a new subsection to the end of "3.10.5 Posting to Outputs" in
EGL_EXT_output_base:

    3.10.5.1 Synchronization with DRM-KMS Operations

    Valid attributes that allow synchronization between EGL and clients
    of both EGL and DRM-KMS are listed in Table 3.10.5.1.1.

        Attribute                    Type
        --------------------------   -------
        EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV   pointer

        Table 3.10.5.1.1 EGL-DRM synchronization attributes

    3.10.5.1.1 EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV Attribute

    The EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV attribute allows to pass down to EGL
    a user-space data pointer that will let clients properly handle page
    flip events whenever a flip issued by EGL is complete. The valid
    value for this attribute is any kind of pointer to client data.

    EGL will not access memory addressed by any of those pointers. It will
    pass data back to the client through a callback function previously
    registered by the client using the corresponding DRM-KMS operations.
    Thus, the client will be the sole owner of the data pointers.

Add to description of eglStreamConsumerAcquireAttribNV in
EGL_NV_stream_attrib:

    If the parameter <attrib_list> contains a EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV
    attribute with its corresponding client data pointer, EGLOutput will
    issue a page flip in such a way the EGL client will get notification
    upon completion through the proper DRM-KMS means.

Add to the list of failures of eglStreamConsumerAcquireAttribNV in
EGL_NV_stream_attrib:

    - EGL_BAD_MATCH is generated if <attrib_list> contains multiple
      EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV attributes.

    - EGL_BAD_ACCESS is generated if <attrib_list> contains
      EGL_DRM_FLIP_EVENT_DATA_NV attribute and the corresponding
      EGLOutput handle does not represent a KMS CRTC object.
